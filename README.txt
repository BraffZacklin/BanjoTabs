Root 1st String
Major: (1) Major 0-2-4-5, (4) 0-2-4, (M6) 0-2-3
Minor: (1) Minor 0-2-3-5, (4) 0-2-3-5, (M6) x-1-3

Minor: (1) Minor 0-2-3-5, (M3), x-1-3, (5) 0-1-3-5

Notes:
Majors are the same, but the 3rd string changes to reflect if D has maj/min7
Minors are also the same, but G root changes D string to phrygian run (as it has p5, m6, m7, root)
