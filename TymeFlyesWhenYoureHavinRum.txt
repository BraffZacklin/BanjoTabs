VERSE
	No future was there | in London for  a      | poor man's son like me
	So I left my home   | and I went to seek my | fortune on the sea
	I signed aboard a merchant ship bound for the west indies
	And six weeks out we | tacked into the      | winds of pira-cy

	There were sails on the horizon and we tried to make a run
	And when we saw that black flag and our running it was done
	When those pirates boarded us they told us one by one
	"You can die or join me crew me boys, time flies when you're having rum!"

CHORUS
	Time flies when you're having rum me boys, time flies when you're having rum!
	When you're sailing under the black flag, and you're firing all your guns
	When you take a Spanish treasure ship, you divide by the rule of thumb
	The voyage will be over soon enough, time flies when you're having rum
