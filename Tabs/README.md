**My Notation**  
Each individual pluck of an open string is marked with a character corresponding to its number  
1 一  
2 二  
3 三  
4 ス or 四  
5 五  
6 六  
  
For guitar and banjo, these correspond to the lowest pitch to highest pitch string  
ス is used because it looks visually cleaner and is easier to handwrite  
  
**Marking frets with numbers**, e.g. 一4 means lowest string fourth fret; if there is no number, it is open unless a chord is stated. Multiple frets may be given in sequence like so: 一-2-4-5  
  
**To suggest a chordshape**, the chord should be placed in round braces before the, e.g. (D7)一二一三  
  
**To strum a chord**, either the chord is named (e.g. 二G means fret G, pluck 二, strum G), or S is used to play a chord already given or strum open all frets. U is an upstrum.  
  
**Lines and motifs** mark arbitrary parts, I usually correspond them to lines of a song. E.g.  
    i 一G 二G  
a-z1-9 is also used to mark sub-sections of lines, aka motifs
  
**Round brackets and repeats**  
Round brackets separate elements for repeats, specified with ()x2  
x's at the end of a numeral line indicate repeating the entire line  
e.g.  
    i (二G)x2 一G  x2  
  
**Fifth String Banjo, the ditty**  
To indicate plucking a string after a chord, as is done frequently in clawhammer, place the number next to the chord without a space, e.g. 一G五, for banjo d is a substitute for the open fifth string.*  
  
**Hammer on, slides, pull offs**  
h, /, \, p may all be used to indicate these as on guitar tab. If you wish to indicate an alternate string pull off, put the string number after the p symbol. To indicate pulling off a fret to open, use 0, e.g. 三3p0, same as any other fret number. 三3p indicates plucking the same string, like in an alternate string pull off  
  
**Plucking up on multiple strings**  
U may be placed before a string number to indicate striking that string and the strings physically above it with an upstroke  
  
**Repeating ditty** % sign, indicates bum-ditty-ditty; to change chords for the second ditty, simply write a different chord after percent, e.g. D%D7, this may be repeated indefinitely

**Comma, Bars** indicates a break in a line, not necessarily rhythmic, usually an instrumental phrase played at the end of a line and before the next. || also serve this purpose, usually for neater organising of parts.
