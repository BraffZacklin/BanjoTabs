LYRICS
(Verse)
No future was there in London for a poor man's son like me
So I left my home and I went to seek my fortune on the sea
I signed aboard a merchant ship bound for the west indies
And six weeks out we tapped into the winds of piracy

There were sails on the horizon and we tried to make a run
But when we saw that black flag then our running it was done
And when those pirates boarded us they told us one by one
"You can die or join our crew me boys, Time flies whеn you're having rum!"

(Chorus)
Time flies whеn you're having rum me boys, time flies when you're having rum
When you're sailing under the black flag and you're firing all your guns
When you take a spanish treasure ship, you divide by the rule of thumb
Our voyage will be over soon enough, time flies when you're having rum

With a pistol to my forehead, then my choice was all too clear
I took leave of that merchant ship and became a buccaneer
And though they spared my life I think that if the truth be told
I joined them for the promise of adventure, rum and gold

The quartermaster handed me a cutlass and a gun
And as I signed their articles the captain told me "Son
Us gentlemen of fortune live life fast and on the run
So step right up and take your share, time flies when you're having rum!"

(Chorus)

For two long years I sailed with them around the Spanish Main
And capture ships from Portugal, from England, France and Spain
We took what we could and we gave none back, for that's the pirate's code
And in our wake the Caribbean Sea ran red with blood

The admiralty in London sent a fleet to hunt us down
A traitor in Port Royal told them where we could be found
They surrounded us in Nassau, the captain shouted "Let 'em come!"
"The fight will be over soon enough, time flies when you're having rum."

(Chorus)

We ran the red flag up and then we readied all our guns
No quarter would we give and in turn expected none
We got off one good broadside, but outnumbered ten to one
They took out half our crew, and then our pirating was done

They took us back to London Town nder key and lock
The hangman's noose was swinging at the execution dock
The captain turned and said to me, "We had fine sailing son
The voyage it was over all too soon, time flies when you're having rum."

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Now as you've listened to this tale by now, I'm sure you have surmised
That I slipped the hangman's cable, and escaped him with my life
But how I got away, well that's another story son
My voyages they aren’t over yet, time flies when you're having rum!

(Chorus)
