Lyrics
  an old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
  Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
  When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
  Plowing through the ragged sky, and up a cloudy draw

  Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
  Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
  A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
  He saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry

  yippie-kai-ai-oh
  yippie-kai-ai-ay
  Ghost riders in the sky

  Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
  He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
  'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
  On horses snorting fire, as they ride on hear their cry

  As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
  If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range
  Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
  Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies

  yippie-kai-ai-oh
  yippie-kai-ai-ay
  Ghost riders in the sky
