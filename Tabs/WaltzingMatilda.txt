Lyrics
  Once a jolly swagman camped out by the billabong
  Under the shade of the coolibah tree
  And he sang as he watched as he waited for his billy boil
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

(Chorus played after each verse, but line 3 changes to match)
  Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
  He sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

  Down came a jumbuck to drink up at the billabong
  Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
  And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker bag
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

  Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred
  Up rode the troopers, one, two, three
  "With that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?" --shortii
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

  Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong
  "You won't take me alive", said he  -----------------------shorti
  And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
