Lyrics
  Once a jolly swagman camped out by the billabong
  Under the shade of the coolibah tree
  And he sang as he watched as he waited for his billy boil
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

(Chorus played after each verse, but line 3 changes to match)
  Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
  And he sang as he watched as he waited for his billy boil
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

  Down came a jumbuck to drink up at the billabong
  Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee
  And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker bag
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

  Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred
  Up rode the troopers, one, two, three
  "Now, with that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?"
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"

  Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong
  "You'll never take me alive", said he
  And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong
  "You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me"
