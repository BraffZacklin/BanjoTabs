**Lyrics**
As I was walking down the street -pluck
Down the street, down the street
A pretty girl I chanced to meet -pull
And we danced by the light of the moon

CHORUS
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight -pull
Come out tonight come out tonight
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight
And we'll dance by the light of the moon

I danced with a gal with feathers in her hair -pluck
Feathers in her hair, feathers in her hair
I danced with a girl with feathers in her hair
And we danced from dawn till noon

I danced all night with a bottle in my hand -pluck
bottle in my hand, bottle in my hand,
I danced all night with a bottle in my hand,
And we danced in the light of the moon.

Woke up in the morning with a banging in my head -pluck
Banging in my head, banging in my head
Woke up in the morning with a banging in my head
Chucked a sickie, took the day off

Well I got a call when I was in bed
I was in bed, I was in bed
My boss didn't like it, so I just said shove it
And I got the next week off

Well I talked with my union
And they were in tune
Said this just wasn't on
And I got my workers comp
Well I talked with my union, maybe you should do too
