Lyrics
  Come all of you good workers,
  Good news to you I'll tell
  About how the good old union
  Has come in here to dwell 

  Which side are you on, folks?
  Which side are you on?

  My dady was a miner,
  So I'm a miner's son,
  And I'll stick with the union
  Til every battle's won

  They say in Harlan county,
  There are no neutrals there
  That you'll either be a union man,
  Or a thug for JH Blair

  Oh workers can you stand it?
  Oh tell me how you can?
  So will you be a lousy scab
  Or will you be a man? 

  Don't scab for the bosses
  Don't listen to their lies
  Us poor folks haven't got a chance
  Unless we organize
