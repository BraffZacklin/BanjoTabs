Lyrics
  Come all of you good workers,
  Good news to you I'll tell
  About how the good old union --longii
  Has come in here to dwell 

  Which side are you on, folks?
  Which side are you on?

  My dady was a miner,
  So I'm a miner's son,
  And I'll stick with the union
  Til every battle's won

  They say in Harlan county,
  There are no neutrals there
  That you'll either be a union man, --longii
  Or a thug for JH Blair

  Oh workers can you stand it?
  Oh tell me how you can?
  Will you be a lousy scab --scab2
  Or will you be a man? 

  Don't scab for the bosses
  Don't listen to their lies
  Us poor folks haven't got a chance
  Unless we organize
